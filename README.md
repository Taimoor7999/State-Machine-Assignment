State-Machine-Assignment 
Task Description
To implement a finite state machine (FSM) that recognizes two specific sequences of applied input symbols, namely four consecutive 1s or four consecutive 0s. There is an input w and an output z. Whenever w = 1 or w = 0 for four consecutive clock pulses the value of z has to be 1; otherwise, z = 0. Overlapping sequences are allowed, so that if w = 1 for five consecutive clock pulses the output z will be equal to 1 after the fourth and fifth pulses.
